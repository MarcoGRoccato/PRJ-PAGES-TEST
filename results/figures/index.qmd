## Published Figures

The images below are all files in this folder (`results/figures/`).  
Add more images here and re-render to update this gallery.

```{python}
import os, glob

# Folder that contains this page AND the images
folder = "results/figures"

# Image extensions to include
exts = ("*.png","*.jpg","*.jpeg","*.gif","*.svg","*.webp")

# Collect matching files (sorted)
files = []
for pattern in exts:
    files.extend(sorted(glob.glob(os.path.join(folder, pattern))))

# Emit Markdown for each image; use just the basename so links are relative
if files:
    for f in files:
        name = os.path.basename(f)
        print(f"### {name}\n")
        print(f"![]({name})\n")
else:
    print("_No figures yet. Add images to this folder and render again._")
